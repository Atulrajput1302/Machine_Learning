# What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning a supplement using which machines can be made intelligent, this means they can take decisions on their own, classify things, predict things, recommend things based on your likes.

So in a nutshell using techniques of Machine Learning you can make a Artificially intelligent machine and this is the basic difference between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Artificial Intelligence is a quality/characteristic of a machine which is achieved using techniques of Machine Learning.

The techniques of Machine Learning is divided into three parts or there are three types of learning using which machines can achieve different qualities:

## Supervised Learning:
In this method, we ask machines questions and compare machine’s answer from actual answer and instruct machines to minimize the error which it makes. It is same as teaching your child some arithmetic operation and then when child does a mistake you correct that and instruct him/her to don’t repeat that again and this is how he/she minimizes its mistake. Using this learning Machines can do things like:
* Diagnostics
* Can learn how to retain a customer
* Classify Images
* Detect Fraud
* Weather Forecasting
* Market Forecasting
* Estimating Life Expectancy
 ## Unsupervised Learning:
In this learning you give your machine huge chunks of data and instruct it to find some sort of pattern in that and based on those patterns your machines accomplish certain tasks. It works somewhat similar to human brain, how we learn behaviour patterns of people and then learn whom to trust and whom to not. So on basis of data which is life experience here we learn. Using this learning machines can do:
* Customer Segmentation
* Targeted Marketing
* Recommendation (Example: YouTube home page)
* Meaningful Compression of Data
* Big Data Visualization
## Reinforcement Learning: 
In this learning Machine is left in an environment where some thing is happening and there is a reward if machine does what we want and there is a punishment if machine does what we don’t want and based on it we instruct machine to maximize the reward and eventually machine learns how to do thing which we want it to do. Using this type of learning machines can:
* Play Games (PUBG/GTA 5/Chess)
* Acquire Skill
* Learn Tasks
* Navigation
* Take Decisions(Real Time)

So this was an introduction to machine learning.
